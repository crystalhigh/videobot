        As part of registering, or submitting billing information, to the Platform, Customer agrees to provide us with updated, accurate and complete billing information, and authorize VIDGEN(either directly or through our affiliates, subsidiaries or other third parties) to charge, request and collect payment (or otherwise charge, refund or take any other billing actions) from Customer's payment method or designated banking account, and to make any inquiries that we may consider necessary to validate Customer's designated payment account or financial information, in order to ensure prompt payment, including for the purpose of receiving updated payment details from Customer's credit card company or banking account (e.g., updated expiry date or card number as may be provided to us by Customer's credit card company).

        In order to ensure that Customer will not experience any interruption or loss of services, these Terms include an automatic renewal option by default, according to which, unless Customer disables the auto-renewal option or cancels its Service Plan prior to the end of the Subscription Term, the Agreement will automatically renew upon the end of the then applicable Subscription Term, for a renewal period equal to the greater of (i) a minimum of one (1) year or (ii) equal in time to the original Subscription Term (excluding extended periods) - and, unless otherwise notified to Customer, at the same price (subject to applicable Tax changes and excluding any discount or other promotional offer provided for the first Subscription Term). Accordingly, unless either Customer or vidGEN terminates these Terms prior to their expiration, we will attempt to automatically charge Customer the applicable Fees upon or immediately prior to the expiration of the then applicable Subscription Term. If Customer wishes to avoid such auto-renewal, Customer must terminate these Terms at least sixty (60) days prior to their expiration, at any time through the vidGEN Account settings or by contacting us. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, in case a Customer terminates these Terms during the Subscription Term, the Subscription Term will not renew for an additional period, but Customer will not be refunded or credited for any unused period within the existing Subscription Term.

        For any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or in relation to these Terms or any Order Agreement between you and vidGEN or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, or your access or use of the Platform (together “<b>Dispute</b>”), you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the Dispute with us informally. If the parties are unable able to resolve the Dispute informally, you and we agree to resolve any Dispute through binding arbitration before a single arbitrator pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures on an individual basis with no class relief. The arbitrator shall be a retired judge or justice of any New York State or federal court and shall follow New York substantive law in adjudicating the Dispute. This Section shall be construed as a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and shall satisfy the “writing” requirement of the FAA. If the value of your claim in the Dispute does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and VIDGEN submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. THE AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND A WAIVER OF THE ABILITY TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN A CLASS ACTION. All claims must be brought in your individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative capacity. Notwithstanding any other provision in these Terms or in the JAMS Rules to the contrary, the arbitrator shall have no authority to hear or determine any matters relating to any class claims or any claims asserted by class members or class representatives, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator shall have no authority to consolidate any arbitration claims Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights and for matters related to data security or unauthorized access to the Platform.

        You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and vidGEN are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and to any right you may have to participate as a class representative or class member on any class claim you may have against vidGEN including any right to class arbitration or any consolidation of individual arbitrations. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person, if we are a party to the proceeding.
